# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 Work
## Project Overvew
This project focused on collecting and slicing data sets to prepare for a presentation at PyBer, a ride-sharing company. My boss asked me to prepare for a big presentation using different types of dataframes and plots relating to driver counts, city type, and riders' fares. I was able to produce the requested results in advance of the big presentation using my newfound plotting skills. 


## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv, PyBer_ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1 (with pandas library), Jupyter Notebooks

## Results

The results of our analysis are helpful in understanding PyBer's rideshare data. Before diving in, here's the summary dataframe:
